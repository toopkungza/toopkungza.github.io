							<h1 class="major">My Bio</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Graduated with first-class honours for my bachelors in English from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, I have spent years after graduation learning coding skills, mostly in C, C++, and Python.
							I have a hand-on experience in database management (SQL), server maintenance, UNIX system (kernel build and configuration), and natural language processing (at a very basic level, mostly with NLTK for splicing, tokenization, and preprocessing).
							As an data science enthusiast myself, I feel fascinating very time when there is a groundbreaking news on progress of AI, NLP, and quantum computing.</p>

							<p>I found a source of inspiration for python coding and becoming a good programmer when I took a NLP I course at Chulalongkorn University as a graduate student in Linguistics. Ajarn Te <a href="https://attapol.github.io/">(Dr. Attapol Rutherford) </a>is an extremely good lecturer who knew how to teach the hard coding stuff in an simple and fun way.
							It has been my privilege to have attended two courses taught by him (NLP I and Syntax) at the time I studied there. If you are interested in learning natural language processing from the beginning but have no idea where to start, I would highly recommend you to go visit his website. You will be surprised to discover so many courses (and a lot of good stuff, too!) on that website, all for free of course.</p>
							
							<p>My current focus right now would be mastering my coding skills in Python. And it seems that I need to re-learn RegEx from the beginning (yeah, ChatGPT helps me A LOT). Coding project collaboration is always welcome. Feel free to contact me.</p>

							<p>By the way, my nickname in Thai is ธูป. But most foreigners I worked with in the past called me Sukrit. I don't mind you calling my nickname in Thai or my first name, but please choose just one and stick with it to prevent confusion on my side. :P Oh, and yeah, I am one of Sam Smith's fans in Thailand...</p>
