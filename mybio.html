							<h1 class="major">My Bio</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Graduated with first-class honours for my BA in English from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), I have spent years after graduation learning coding skills, mostly in C, C++, and Python.
							I have a hand-on experience in database management (SQL), server maintenance, UNIX system (kernel build and configuration), and natural language processing (at a very basic level, mostly with NLTK for splicing, tokenization, and preprocessing).
							As someone who loves data science, I’m endlessly amazed by the leaps AI, NLP, and quantum computing take—each breakthrough feels like watching the future unfold, piece by piece. There’s something almost poetic about how these technologies stretch what we thought was possible.</p>

							<p>My journey into Python and programming truly began when I took an NLP course during my Linguistics graduate studies at Chulalongkorn University. There, Ajarn Te <a href="https://attapol.github.io/">(Dr. Attapol Rutherford) </a>became my guiding light—he had this rare gift for making complex coding concepts feel simple, even joyful. That class didn’t just teach me syntax; it showed me how language and technology could dance together, and that revelation still inspires my code today.
							I feel incredibly fortunate to have studied under his guidance—both in NLP I and Syntax during my time at the university. If you’re curious about natural language processing but don’t know where to begin, let me share a hidden treasure: his GitHub. There, you’ll find not just courses, but gateways—all thoughtfully shared for free, because the best knowledge should be open to every wandering mind. Trust me, you’ll leave inspired.</p>
							
							<p>My current focus right now would be mastering my coding skills in Python. Coding project collaboration is always welcome. Feel free to contact me.</p>

							<p>By the way, my nickname in Thai is ธูป. But most foreigners I worked with in the past called me Sukrit. I don't mind you calling my nickname in Thai or my first name, but please choose just one and stick with it to prevent confusion on my side. Oh, and full disclosure: I’m absolutely one of Sam Smith’s Thai fanfolk—their music hits my soul in that way, you know?</p>
